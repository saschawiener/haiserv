# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Local timetable cache: a failed fetch (for example HTTP 403 after a school
  disabled the timetable for parents and students) now falls back to the last
  successfully fetched timetable instead of failing. Only the latest successful
  version is kept per timetable (current and next week separately). The timetable
  sensor exposes the fallback via the `cached` state attribute.
- **iServ Notifications** sensor: polls `/iserv/user/api/notifications` every
  5 minutes and exposes the current notification feed (id, type, title,
  message, deep-link URL, icon, date) plus a `last_id` attribute meant as a
  stable trigger anchor for automations. Intended to replace IServ's own push
  notifications, which are unreliable once an account is logged in on
  multiple devices.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-09-18

### Initial release

HAiServ is a Home Assistant custom integration for [iServ](https://iserv.de/) school platforms. It exposes timetable and parent letter data as Home Assistant sensor entities.

---

### Features

#### Timetable sensors

- **Current week timetable** (`sensor.iserv_timetable`) — state shows the next upcoming lesson as `{subject} {start}-{end}`; falls back to `No upcoming lessons` or `No lessons` when the week is empty.
- **Next week timetable** (`sensor.iserv_next_week_timetable`) — state shows total lesson count for the following week.
- Both sensors expose full attributes:
  - `lessons` — structured list of all lessons including cancellation status
  - `timetable_data` — raw JSON returned by the iServ API
  - `timetable_table` — pre-formatted Markdown table ready for Lovelace
  - `last_updated` — ISO 8601 timestamp of the last successful poll

#### Parent letter sensor

- **Parent letters** (`sensor.iserv_parent_letters`) — state shows `{N} unread` or `No unread letters`.
- Attributes include the full letter list (subject, sender, child, recipient, created_at, is_unread) sorted unread-first, plus `unread_count` and `total_count`.

#### Multi-generation timetable API support

Automatically detects which timetable endpoint the iServ instance exposes and selects the correct one:

1. DieSchulApp JSON API (`/iserv/public/timetable/current`) — newest installs
2. Timetable data endpoint (`/iserv/timetable/data`) — mid-generation installs
3. Legacy HTML endpoint (`/iserv/timetable`) — older installs

The detected endpoint is cached per session. Fallback proceeds automatically if the preferred endpoint becomes unavailable.

#### Session and authentication handling

- UI-based config flow — enter URL, username, and password; credentials are validated before the entry is created.
- Automatic session re-authentication on 401/403 responses.
- Entities remain available during transient failures by serving stale data. After 3 consecutive failures with no cached data the entity is marked unavailable.

#### Lovelace dashboard

A ready-made Lovelace dashboard (`dashboards/`) renders the timetable as a Markdown table with:
- Current week range in the heading
- Today's column header highlighted
- The currently active lesson row highlighted

#### Model Context Protocol (MCP) server

An optional MCP server (`mcp_server.py`) exposes the iServ timetable to LLM clients (e.g. Claude Desktop). Supports session reuse so the iServ login is performed once per process lifetime.

### Bug fixes

- Translation placeholder `{url}` in the config-flow success message is now correctly resolved.
- `_EndpointUnavailable` raised when all timetable endpoint variants are exhausted is now converted to `CannotConnect`, preventing an unhandled exception in the update coordinator.

---

### Requirements

- Home Assistant 2023.1 or newer
- `aiohttp` (declared as integration dependency)
- An iServ account with timetable access
